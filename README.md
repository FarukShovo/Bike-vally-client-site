<li> I used lots of components in client side.</li>
<li>In server side, any user can add, delete or update his/her liking as well as rating, make order and purchase.</li>
<li>There was a dashboard part and where admin can login with (email address: admin@admin.com & password: 123456).</li>
<li>Font awesome & private route were used for the project.</li>
<li>Used netlify for deployment</li>
<li>I had to make Email Authentication and password with Google sign in.
